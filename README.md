Campus Wayfinding App

The final and from here on out, only repo that project members should be committing to, this is to prevent mis management of our projects code.  

From here on our master brench is the following: 
https://github.com/ITECH3208andITECH3209feduni/CampusWayfindingApp/tree/main

I will be doing a repo clean out and removing unused and stale branches over the summer (2020) as well as keeping old code and early prototype versions of the project (in their own branches) here for archive purposes only as well as any tools we made.
